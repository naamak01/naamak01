### Hi there, I'm 👋

<h1>Nana</h1>

**`Curious Mind (Developer| IT professional| YouTuber)`**

A recent graduate of Wayne State College who studied Computer Science, Marketing, and Management. All the codes I have public are built from scratch
except the Portfolio website which I used as a tutorial. 

A recent interest I have been pursuing has been QA and IT, specifically Cloud, Networking, Security, and Operating systems and how
it impacts businesses.

Similar to my YouTube videos which are to help other students and nothing 
related to programming I learned everything from editing, posting, video ideas, and research. My YouTube is non-coding related but is something I do educate other people. I have a creative mindset and pay close attention
to details. Someone will say I have an artistic touch. If you are curious about my channel, you are welcome to check it out. I have a little over 15k subscribers. Channel name "[@nanakwesiamakye](https://www.youtube.com/@nanakwesiamakye)".
