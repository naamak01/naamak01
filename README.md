### Hi there, I'm 👋

<h1>Nana</h1>

**`Curious Mind (Developer| IT professional| YouTuber)`**

A recent graduate of Wayne State College who studied Computer Science, Marketing, and Management. All the codes I have public are built from scratch
except the Portfolio website which I used as a tutorial. 

A recent interest I have been pursuing has been QA and IT, specifically Cloud, Networking, Security, and Operating systems and how
it impacts businesses.

I have a YouTube Channel which I use to help other students and nothing related to programming. I learned everything from editing, posting, video ideas, and research. My YouTube is non-coding related but is something I do educate other people. I have a creative mindset and pay close attention
to details. Someone will say I have an artistic touch. If you are curious about my channel, you are welcome to check it out. I have a little over 15k subscribers. Channel name "[@nanakwesiamakye](https://www.youtube.com/@nanakwesiamakye)".
