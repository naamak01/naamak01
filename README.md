### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h1>Nana Amakye</h1>

**`Curious Mind (Developer/YouTuber)`**

I am a senior at Wayne State majoring in Computer Science, Marketing, and Management. All the codes I have public are built from scratch
except the Portfolio website which I used as a tutorial. Similar to my YouTube videos which are to help other students and nothing 
related to programming I learned everything from editing, posting, video ideas, and research. My YouTube is non-coding related but is something I do educate other people. I have a creative mindset and pay close attention
to details. Someone will say I have an artistic touch. If you are curious about my channel, you are welcome to check it out. I have a little over 15k subscribers. Channel name "[@nanakwesiamakye](https://www.youtube.com/@nanakwesiamakye)".
