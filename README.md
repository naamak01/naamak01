### Hi there, I'm ðŸ‘‹

<h1>Nana</h1>

**`Curious Mind (Developer/YouTuber)`**

I am a senior at Wayne State majoring in Computer Science, Marketing, and Management. All the codes I have public are built from scratch
except the Portfolio website which I used as a tutorial. Similar to my YouTube videos which are to help other students and nothing 
related to programming I learned everything from editing, posting, video ideas, and research. My YouTube is non-coding related but is something I do educate other people. I have a creative mindset and pay close attention
to details. Someone will say I have an artistic touch. If you are curious about my channel, you are welcome to check it out. I have a little over 15k subscribers. Channel name "[@nanakwesiamakye](https://www.youtube.com/@nanakwesiamakye)".

<summary>:zap:Nana's Coding Journey</summary>
    I started my coding journey just 2 years ago, as I was in my final year of graduating with a double major in Marketing, and Management. The idea of coding or learning how to build something with code was something I never really thought about. I just jumped into it      head first not knowing how tough the path can be. During the last couple of years as a Computer Science Major, I have learned and played with a few coding languages like Java, C++, and Python, and currently teaching myself Javascript. This journey has not been easy.     There have been times when I just wanted to give up. My imposter syndrome has been over the roof. Last year I took an intro to Web Development and that was when I started enjoying it. I found out just pure back-end is not really for me. I rather enjoy building       web applications, websites, full-stack apps, or things that involve creating things on both the visual and incorporating the back end as well. The road may seem long and scary, but I am ready to take up the challenge.
