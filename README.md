### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**`Curious Mind (Developer/YouTuber)`**

I am a senior at Wayne State majoring in Computer Science, Marketing, and Management. All the codes I have public are built from scratch
with the exception of the Portfolio website which I used a tutorial. Similar4 to my YouTube videos which are to help other students and nothing 
realating to programming I learned everything from editing, posting, video ideas and research. I will say I have a creative mindset and pay close attention
to details. Someone will say I have an artistic touch.
